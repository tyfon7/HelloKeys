# Hello, keys!

This mod dramatically increases key spawns and adds keys that were previously missing to jackets, sports bags, and dead scavs. It's heavily inspired by [KeysInLoot](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1738-keys-in-loot-kil/) by MusicManiac.

However, rather than just adding every key at the same probability, this mod uses the flea prices as a way to gauge value - cheap keys are more plentiful than the valuable ones. 

## Details

Prices for all keys listed on the flea market are used to generate relative probabilities, with the most expensive key at 1 and the cheapest key coming in around 750 (750 times cheaper, so 750 more likely to spawn). 

The keys are added jackets, Sports bags, and dead scavs, starting at the median probability for the rarest key, and projecting the distribution up to the most common item equaling the most common key. So you'll get marked keys often enough to not need the flea, and you'll get useless crappy car keys as often as you get any other garbage ;)

There are 4 keys not listable on the flea market. They are added manually, by default 50 times more common than the rarest marked key (this is configurable).

Keys that are not intended to be dropped from random places are skipped by this mod, this is also configurable.
